# 7-31-DailyChallenge

Quick Reminder: This Code Challenge doesn't assess your worth as a human being. You're great! Deep breath. Have fun.

Base Mode

Create a <button> element on the DOM, you may do this in jQuery, or write it directly in the HTML code. Have the button text read "Generate".

Using jQuery, append a <div> element when you click the button.

Inside the <div> element you created in the previous step, create a <p> element that shows how many times you have clicked the button from the first step.

Inside the <div> element you created in step two, append two <button> elements. The text of the two buttons should read "Swap" and "Delete".

In a CSS file, any <div> created using the "Generate" button should have a Red background-color.

Clicking a "Delete" <button> should remove its parent <div> container (and all of its contents).

Hard Mode

Clicking a "Swap" <button> should change its parent background-color from Red to Yellow.

Clicking a "Swap" <button> again should change its parent background-color from Yellow back to Red.

No need to do anything beyond the challenge described above. Once you are complete, check your code into a GitHub repo and submit via this application.

Ok, it's been a pretty crazy week. This stuff is hard. Take some time to review all of the things we've covered in such a short time. This is not a part of your challenge, and you do not need to submit this. Just use it for some review: Week 1 Review
